### Example Conversation

```
AI: Hi! I'm your rent vs buy advisor. Tell me about your situation - 
    what's the price of the house you're looking at?

You: I'm looking at a $500,000 home

AI: Got it! Now, what's your current monthly rent?

You: $3,000

AI: And what down payment are you thinking?

You: 20%

AI: Alright! So with a $500k house and $3k rent, you're looking at 
    pretty similar monthly costs. Want to see how your wealth builds 
    up over 30 years? I can show you your Net Worth Comparison!

You: yes please

AI: Here's your Net Worth Comparison!
    [Chart displays with detailed breakdown]

You: When does buying pay off?

AI: Based on your numbers, buying typically becomes more beneficial 
    around year 7-8, when your home equity and appreciation start 
    outpacing what you'd have by renting and investing. Want to see 
    the Total Cost Comparison over 30 years?
```
